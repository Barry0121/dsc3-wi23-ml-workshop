# Data Science Student Society - Machine Learning & Deep Learning Workshop 

This repository contains all the reference materials for ML/DL workshops. 

## How to navigate this repo? 

<b>For workshop participants:</b> 
* You can find the code in the `notebook` directory and the slides in the `slides` directory. 
* All the workshop content should be in its independent folders; the name of the folder should be your workshop name.  
* Datasets are usually not stored in this repository. Go to https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IAG4U91Y811WW-coUOg4upHNDveD4mfH?usp=sharing to download the corresponding datasets. 

<b>For workshop members:</b>
* You can put whatever you are working on in your corresponding folder, just keep in mind the repository is public, so everyone with the link <b>is able to see your work</b>. 
* A week before the workshop, make sure to do the following: 
  1. Move any datasets to google drive, no datasets should be on GitHub, unless you want to clone a repository GBs in size. 
  2. Put your slides (or any reference material you want to present/make available) in the `slides/<your-work-shop>` folder. 
  3. Reformat your notebook so it is streamlined and presentable. If someone downloaded your notebook, they should be able to follow along without asking you basic questions like "which dataset am I using for this problem?" or "how to download this package?".  In other words, write good comments! 

### Have fun palying around with the code! 
### Big thank you to all the workshop members that contributed to this repository!
